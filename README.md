# Flutter Playground

This is my playground project for Flutter. 

## Platforms
This is targeting all 6 supported platforms. Android, iOS, Web, MacOS, Windows & Linus

# Feature Scope
Plan is to build it into a full fledged app with data persistence and networking. Resulting apps will let users browse trending "language" related repositories on Github. They will consume Github's free APIs to fetch, store and display trending repositories related to programming languages.

## Backlog
